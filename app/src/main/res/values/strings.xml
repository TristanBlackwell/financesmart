    <string name="emergencyfundDescription">No one likes to think about it but sometimes things don\'t go in our favour. In the UK around 26%% people have savings of less than £1,000. Take a moment to think about how long this would last you if from tomorrow your income disappeared. An emergency fund aims to reduce this worry by keeping an accessible sum of money aside that you don\'t touch unless something unexpected happens which catches you off guard. This should be set aside and not as a pot to dip into, instead only for genuine emergencies. The optimal emergency fund can be anywhere from 6 months outgoings to 12 months depending on your risk appetite
    and this gives you that extra piece of mind so you don\'t need to worry. Also your first priority once your back on your feet is to replenish its value. Look after your emergency fund so it can look after you!</string>
